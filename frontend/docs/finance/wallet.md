# Wallet feature

The wallet is the base of the accounting module.
Without any wallet the user can't do anything, it's the first step on this module.

It will be able to add more wallets, update or delete existing one.

Once a waller created, the ui will show him the current transactions of this wallet and the summary will be base on this wallet only.
